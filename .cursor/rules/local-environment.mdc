# Local Environment Configuration

## Domain
- Local development domain: `tarmac.wip`
- Always use the Symfony proxy when making CURL requests to the local environment

## Symfony Server
- Use `bin/server` to start the Symfony server with the proxy
- Do not use `php bin/console server:start` (not available in this setup)
- Do not try to restart the server manually. It has no effect most of the time.
- When trying to clear the cache, use `symfony console cache:clear` instead of `bin/console cache:clear`
