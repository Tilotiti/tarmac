# Local Environment Configuration

## Domain
- Local development domain: `tarmac.wip`
- Local URL: `https://www.tarmac.wip`
- The URL to test a club app is `https://demo.tarmac.wip`
- Always use the Symfony proxy when making CURL requests to the local environment

## Symfony Server
- Use `bin/server` to start the Symfony server with the proxy
- Do not use `php bin/console server:start` (not available in this setup)
- Do not try to restart the server manually. It has no effect most of the time.
- When trying to clear the cache, use `symfony console cache:clear` instead of `bin/console cache:clear`

## Testing Workflow

When the user asks to test the application:

1. **First, verify the Symfony server is running**
   - Do NOT attempt to start the Symfony server yourself
   - If the server is not running, ask the user to start it manually
   
2. **Use the correct local URL**
   - Always navigate to: `https://www.tarmac.wip`
   
3. **Chrome Proxy Configuration Fix**
   - If Google Chrome shows an "UNRESOLVED" issue when trying to access the site:
     - Navigate to: `chrome://net-internals/proxyservice.config#proxy`
     - Click the "Reapply-settings" button
     - Then retry accessing the site
   - This is a common proxy configuration issue that requires this manual intervention
   
4. **Proceed with testing**
   - Once the site loads properly, proceed with functional testing of the requested features
