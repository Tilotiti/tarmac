## ✅ Implemented Changes

### 1. **Ownership-Based Permissions**

**Added to SubTask Entity:**
- `createdBy` (User) - Tracks who created the subtask

**Task Entity Already Had:**
- `createdBy` field was already present
- No changes needed

**Database Migration:**
- Created: `migrations/Version20251029112734.php`

## 🎯 Key Behavior Changes

### For Members (Non-Manager)

**Can Now:**
- ✅ Edit their own tasks (if open/done)
- ✅ Cancel their own open tasks
- ✅ Edit their own open subtasks
- ✅ Cancel their own open subtasks

**Still Cannot:**
- ❌ Edit tasks/subtasks they didn't create
- ❌ Edit anything that's closed/cancelled
- ❌ Edit subtasks that are in 'done' status
- ❌ Delete anything (feature removed)

### For Managers

**Can Now:**
- ✅ Edit any task (if not closed/cancelled)
- ✅ Cancel any open task
- ✅ Edit any open subtask
- ✅ Cancel any open subtask

**Cannot Anymore:**
- ❌ Edit subtasks in 'done' status (waiting for inspection)
- ❌ Cancel done/closed subtasks
- ❌ Delete anything (feature removed)

**Why This Is Better:**
- Prevents accidental changes to subtasks waiting for inspection
- Forces proper workflow: reject → edit → redo
- Maintains data integrity

### For Inspectors

**Can Now:**
- ✅ Approve/reject with same rules
- ✅ Edit/cancel their own open items (like any member)

**Still Cannot:**
- ❌ Approve inspections if status is not 'done' (even as admin)

### For Admins

**Rights Clarified:**
- Admin = Manager + Inspector combined
- Follows same status rules as managers/inspectors
- Cannot bypass status rules (e.g., can't approve if status ≠ 'done')

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Run the Migration

```bash
symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

This will add the `createdBy` and `createdAt` fields to the `sub_task` table.

### 2. Test the New Permissions

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Member can edit their own open task
- [ ] Member cannot edit someone else's task
- [ ] Member can cancel their own open task
- [ ] Member can edit their own open subtask
- [ ] Member can cancel their own open subtask
- [ ] Member cannot edit subtask in 'done' status
- [ ] Member cannot cancel subtask in 'done' status
- [ ] Manager can edit any open task
- [ ] Manager can edit any open subtask
- [ ] Manager cannot edit subtask in 'done' status
- [ ] Inspector can only approve if status = 'done'
- [ ] Admin has same restrictions as inspector for approval

### 3. Update UI (If Needed)

**Check These Areas:**
- Task list page: Edit/Cancel buttons should show based on ownership
- Task detail page: Edit/Cancel actions should respect new rules
- SubTask list: Edit/Cancel buttons should respect status and ownership
- SubTask detail page: Edit form should only show for open subtasks

**Suggested UI Changes:**
- Show "Created by: [Name]" on tasks/subtasks
- Different button labels: "Edit My Task" vs "Edit Task" (manager)
- Disable/hide buttons with tooltip explaining why (e.g., "Can only edit open subtasks")

### 4. Optional: Add Indexes

For performance with large datasets:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_task_created_by ON task(created_by_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_subtask_created_by ON sub_task(created_by_id);
```

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### For Existing Users

1. **Existing SubTasks Will Have `createdBy = NULL`**
   - SubTasks created before this migration won't have a creator
   - They can only be edited/cancelled by managers
   - Consider running a data migration if you want to attribute them

2. **Managers Can No Longer Edit 'Done' SubTasks**
   - This is intentional to prevent conflicts during inspection
   - Workflow: Inspector rejects → Member edits → Member re-does

3. **DELETE Feature Removed**
   - Any UI that used DELETE routes will need updating
   - Grep showed no existing DELETE routes in controllers

   - **Benefit:** Empowers members, reduces manager workload

3. **Issue: DELETE vs CANCEL Confusion**
   - **Solution:** Removed DELETE, only CANCEL exists
   - **Benefit:** Clearer workflow, better audit trail

   - **Solution:** Explicitly defined as Manager + Inspector
   - **Benefit:** Consistent and predictable behavior

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the documentation:**
   - `PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md` - Complete rules
   - `PERMISSIONS_CHEATSHEET.md` - Quick reference

2. **Common issues:**
   - "Can't edit": Check if item is open and you're the owner/manager
   - "Can't cancel": Check if item is open
   - "Can't approve": Check if subtask status = 'done' and you're inspector

3. **Debug mode:**
   - Check voter decision in Symfony profiler
   - Look for `TaskVoter` or `SubTaskVoter` in debug toolbar

## ✨ Benefits of New System

1. **Member Empowerment**
   - Members can manage their own tasks/subtasks
   - Reduces dependency on managers

2. **Better Data Integrity**
   - Can't edit items waiting for inspection
   - Forces proper workflow

3. **Clearer Audit Trail**
   - No DELETE operation (only CANCEL)
   - Track who created each item

4. **Simplified Permissions**
   - "If you created it, you can edit/cancel it (when open)"

5. **Consistent Admin Behavior**
   - Admin = Manager + Inspector
   - No special unlimited powers (except for closed tasks)

## 📝 Notes

- All changes are backward compatible with existing data
- Migration handles existing subtasks gracefully
- No changes required to existing templates (just permission checks)
- Admin privileges remain powerful but predictable
